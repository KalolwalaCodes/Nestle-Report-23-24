        2023 was a year of paradox. Notable milestones were achieved, leaving an
        indelible mark on our collective memory. India surpassed China to become
        the world’s most populous country, positioning India favourably and
        solidifying its trajectory towards becoming one of the foremost
        economies worldwide.

        demanding urgent action.

        Fostering a positive organizational culture is vital for achieving
        excellent outcomes. A sense of belonging, where employees are fully seen
        and heard, necessitates a blend of empowerment, respect and dignity,

        Women are growing steadily in leadership in your Company and are part of
        succession plans. Their development plans are closely tracked and
        supported across all business units, factories, and branches in a quest
        for a more diverse, inclusive and equitable future. Inclusivity has
        extended to hiring differently abled individuals, with initiatives in
        Sanand and our Nestlé Business Services. A diversified team encompasses
        vibrant streams of thought, fuels innovation and creativity. From the
        most remote corners of the country, to the youngest Gen Z employee, to
        people with different skills, have all collaborated to create a symphony
        of unison in bringing to the fore, ‘Purpose and Values’ in action.

        following a clear roadmap to address climate concerns across its value
        chain, increasing investments and regularly assessing the progress of
        environmental goals. Our eight factories are now entirely coal-free. The
        pace of installing anaerobic biodigesters in dairy farms has been
        accelerated to reduce methane emissions and provide renewable energy to
        farming households.
        <p className="qus-para">Carving our path to progress</p>
        As the road before us unfolds, and we chart out our path to progress, we

        interventions, of doing the right thing, of making meaningful
        contributions and of showing our mettle as we navigate transient clouds.
        It is a story of integrity, dedication, and diligence that nourishes the
        roots and translates into positive impact. n all our efforts the role of
