            Your Company accelerated its growth journey in RUrban markets,
            supplemented by strong growth momentum in metro and mega cities.
            RUrban focus was enhanced by investing in robust distribution
            channels for efficient product delivery. Your Company launched
            products specifically tailored to the needs and preferences of
            RUrban consumers and leveraged technology to optimize sales force
            routes, enhancing productivity and coverage in RUrban areas.
            Implementing strategies to ensure prominent product placement and
            high-attention activities (HAAT) within stores and driving sales
            enabled your Company to meet its ambitious goal of reaching 200,000
            villages.
            <br />
            The 'Retailer Self-Ordering Application' – NesMitra – emerged as a
            game-changer in RUrban markets. This mobile application enables
            retailers to conveniently place orders, boosting engagement and
            overcoming challenges associated with difficult-to-access rural
            locations. NesMitra has a rapidly growing user base, of over 10,000
            active users. It serves as a valuable complementary route- to-market
            solution, streamlining processes. NesMitra's success has been
            recognized within the Nestlé global network as a model for driving
            operational efficiency and speed. <br />
            Your Company also engaged with women from rural areas under Project
            Swabhimaan to foster entrepreneurial skills by upskilling and
            training them. This initiative was first launched in Uttar Pradesh
            and has now scaled up to 25 states, engaging with over 1,900 women
            entrepreneurs.
