              Your Company’s export business delivered good growth.
              Prepared dishes and cooking aids, led by the iconic MAGGI
              Noodles and Sauces, witnessed an increased demand in key markets
              such as Canada, the United States of America, Australia, New
              Zealand, and Singapore. MAGGI Noodles also expanded its
              footprint to newer markets such as Thailand and the Caribbean
              Islands, demonstrating the brand's global appeal with the Indian
              diaspora.

              NESCAFÉ was a key contributor to growth in exports. NESCAFÉ
              SUNRISE continued to gain traction in established markets such
              as Singapore and Taiwan, and achieved a significant milestone
              with its first ever export to Canada. Additionally, NESCAFÉ
              Intenso roasted beans forayed into new markets in Maldives and
              Sri Lanka.
