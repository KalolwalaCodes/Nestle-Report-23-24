<p className='qus-para'>Risks and mitigation</p>
<b>Inflationary risks</b> <br />
<p className='normal-paragraph-container'>
Inflation can adversely affect the buying power of consumers. The potential rise in the cost of raw materials may also impact the profit margins of the Company.
<br />
Your Company proactively mitigates inflationary risks through a comprehensive commodity procurement process. The robust framework includes continuous monitoring of price indices, identification of potential price fluctuations and implementing efficiencies across the value chain to offset volatile commodity prices.
<br />
Your Company has also implemented cost saving initiatives across the value chain to mitigate cost increases.
</p>
<br />
<b>Evolving consumer preferences</b>
<br />
<p className='normal-paragraph-container'>
Consumer preferences have been evolving due to consumption shift driven by diverse demographics, global food trends and changing food habits influenced by social media penetration. Moreover, there is a rise
of aspirational consumers in both urban and rural areas demanding quicker product delivery for purchase decisions. Delay in addressing these changes may impact the growth of the business.
<br />
Your Company considers this risk as an opportunity for growth by building on a strong existing product line of its core brands and launching innovative products in keeping with consumer demand. By leveraging data analytics and market research, it is gaining a deep understanding of what excites today's food enthusiasts. This insight fuels the development of innovative new products that cater to these evolving tastes and dietary preferences of a diverse consumer base residing

<br />
<b>Fake and counterfeit products</b>
<br />
<p className='normal-paragraph-container'>
The presence of counterfeit products not only threatens the safety of consumers but also poses a risk to
trust and credibility. Sub-par experience with fake
or counterfeit products can make consumers wary
of buying genuine products, also leading to financial losses and impacting the brand's reputation.
<br />
Your Company has zero tolerance towards counterfeit manufacturers, sellers, suppliers and even those
that are offering the counterfeits for sale in the trade channels. Your Company has adopted multi-faceted approach including enforcement mechanisms where commissioners appointed by the Court address these issues. The Company has also launched unique campaigns to educate and dissuade consumers from buying counterfeit products.

Ensuring product quality is essential to uphold consumer's trust and Company’s reputation. In the present competitive market, even one instance of compromised product quality can have lasting impact on consumer trust, brand loyalty and the reputation of your Company.

<br />
<b>Data security and cyber attacks</b>
<br />
<p className='normal-paragraph-container'>
The Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry thrives on interconnected systems and technology, but this very reliance makes it vulnerable to cyberattacks. Furthermore, today's complex supply chain is dependent on digital connections. A single breach can disrupt the entire flow of goods, hindering production, distribution, and ultimately, the ability to deliver products to consumers. Moreover, exposed customer data can lead to financial losses, and a damaged reputation for the Company.

<br />
<b>Climate change</b>
<br />
<p className='normal-paragraph-container'>
The FMCG industry faces multiple climate risks, including erratic monsoon patterns, harvest uncertainties and volatile raw material prices. This reliance on weather patterns directly affects rural incomes, consumer demand and trade, accentuating the sector's vulnerability to weather-related risks.
<br />
