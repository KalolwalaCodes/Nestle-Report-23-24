          Confectionery was one of the main drivers of growth for your Company.

        The growth was fueled by the launch of new products, increased media
          exposure, a more extensive and expanding distribution network, and
          innovative brand activations which were all instrumental in the
          portfolio's success.
          <br />
          KITKAT emerged as the star performer, by not only delivering strong
          growth but making Nestlé India the second largest market for the brand
          globally.

          <br />
          This success can be attributed to innovative launches like KITKAT
          Butterscotch and a premium range with Dark, Rich, and Caramel options.
          <br /> MUNCH also performed well in different regions through
          innovations such as MUNCH Max Brownie and MUNCH Fruity to the existing
          range. Other new launches across the portfolio included MILKYBAR
          caramel, and POLO watermelon. These launches were supported by
          targeted advertising, digital and on-ground initiatives.

            Beyond product innovation, creative marketing campaigns played a
          crucial role. KITKAT's 'Fingers Crossed for the Win' campaign
          resonated with audiences during the 2023 Cricket World Cup, while
          MUNCH leveraged the IPL season with its 'Play in the Gully and Meet
          Your Favorite Stars' initiative. This interactive campaign not only
          boosted brand awareness but also generated excitement by offering fans
          a unique opportunity to meet their cricket heroes.
          <br />
          These campaigns, along with influencer partnerships and a focus on
          video platforms, significantly
          enhanced brand visibility and consumer engagement. Your Company
          continued to demonstrate its commitment to sustainability. Two years
          ago the entire confectionery portfolio transitioned into recyclable
          packaging (Design for recycling - D4R) and remains dedicated to using
          recyclable materials. In another initiative, KITKAT benches from
          recycled pastic, were placed in colleges across the country.
