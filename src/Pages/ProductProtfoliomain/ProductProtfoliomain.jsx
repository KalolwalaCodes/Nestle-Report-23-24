          The Out-of-Home business was one of the fastest growing business of your Company in India during the period under review.
          <br />
          It collaborated with McDonald's India (West and South), PVR-INOX, and Krispy Kreme to co-create a menu using KITKAT and NESCAFÉ. Your Company partnered with SOCIAL and BOSS Burger outlets to test launch the MAGGI Professional plant-based range. This range has been especially developed for chefs to cater to the Indian taste palate. The launch of the plant-based range is a part of your Company’s commitment to offer more food choices to consumers.
          <br />
          Your Company continues to make rapid strides on both the food and beverages portfolios in the Out-of-Home space aided by penetration and premiumization. The rapidly growing base of NESCAFÉ machines, backed by cutting-edge solutions catered to a wide spectrum of consumer preferences by offering both
          hot and cold beverages across offices, educational institutes, and healthcare facilities.

          <br /> 
          Food solutions such as MAGGI Coconut Milk Powder continued to accelerate rapidly across HORECA segments with applications in
Thai and Coastal cuisines.
